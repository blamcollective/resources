# bLAM Collection: Resources

<img align="right" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/659173907493203968/mPRcE9Sw.jpg">

A collection of shared open source resources for Baltimore-area libraries, archives, museums and related memory institutions. This resource collection is inspired in part by the example of [MapTime](http://maptime.io/): "an open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge, offering intentional educational support for the beginner." We anticipate developing these resources to make them available through a Jekyll-based website.

# What resources are available here?
